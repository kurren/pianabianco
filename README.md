<h2>professionally</h2>
<p>I've been working on the digital space for over 25 years, I guess that gives me some sort of cred at least as an observer of things passing; maybe I also have something else to say. Wearing different hats at different stages of my professional life, I tried to remain coherent to myself; I changed my mind on various things, and consider change as the fundamental sign of life.</p>

<h3>some things I've worked on that are worth of a press release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>designing the first website for Tissot watches in 2000</li>
  <li>designing the private area for a private bank in 2000</li>
  <li>leading the complete redesign of motogp.com in 6 months in 2008 (the iPhone killed Flash)</li>
  <li>defining the taxonomy and meta data for information retrieval and recommendation systems in London and in Edinburgh in 2010</li>
  <li>omnichannel design as part of the nike.com redesign in 2011</li>
  <li>redesigning a bank from scracth in Greece (under <em>capital control</em>) in 2015</li>
  <li>leading the design of the first global ecommerce for Prada in 2018</li>
  <li>leading the product definition for Seven and the Qiddiya project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2024</li>
</ul>
